# System Patterns

## Architecture
The system relies on a **Memory Bank** architecture where state is explicitly documented in Markdown files.

## Core Components
- **Memory Bank**: `/memory-bank/` (State storage)
- **Agent Rules**: `/.agent/rules/` (Behavior enforcement)

## Folder Structure
```text
/memory-bank/   -> Documentation root
/.agent/rules/  -> Rules for AI agents
```
