T-005-INFRA: Integration test for Supabase Storage infrastructure.

This test validates that the 'raw-uploads' bucket exists and is
accessible with proper read/write permissions.

TDD Phases:
- RED: Test fails because bucket doesn't exist
- GREEN: Bucket created, test passes
- REFACTOR: Code cleanup and optimization (this file)
