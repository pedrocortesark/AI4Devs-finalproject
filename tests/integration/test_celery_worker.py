"""
Integration tests for T-022-INFRA: Redis & Celery Worker Setup

These tests verify:
1. Redis service is accessible and functional
2. Celery worker configuration is valid
3. Task execution, retry policies, and error handling
4. Security configurations (serialization)
5. Integration with PostgreSQL and Supabase Storage

Status: TDD-GREEN Phase
Expected: All tests should PASS with infrastructure implemented.
