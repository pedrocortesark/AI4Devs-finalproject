T-0503-DB: Integration tests for low_poly_url & bbox columns + indexes.

This test suite validates that the migration 20260219000001_add_low_poly_url_bbox.sql
successfully adds two columns (low_poly_url TEXT, bbox JSONB) and two indexes
(idx_blocks_canvas_query, idx_blocks_low_poly_processing) to the blocks table.

TDD Phases:
- RED: Tests fail because columns/indexes don't exist yet (THIS FILE)
- GREEN: Migration executed, tests pass
- REFACTOR: N/A (migration code is already clean)
